# sqlalchemy2-datatables

sqlalchemy2-datatables is a framework agnostic library providing an SQLAlchemy integration of 
jQuery DataTables >= 1.10, and helping you manage server side requests in your application.

This project was inspired by [sqlalchemyw-datatables](https://github.com/Pegase745/sqlalchemy-datatables) 
developed by Michel Nemnom aka [Pegase745](https://github.com/Pegase745).

Key motivation was compatibility with [SQLAlchemy2.0](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/).
